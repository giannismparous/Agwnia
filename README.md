# Agwnia
Agwnia is a card game coded in python (First semester). The app permits multiplayer (as many player as the user decides) as well as singleplayer (the bot tries to act as smart as possible so it's quite hard). The game has rounds and in every round the winner is declared according to everyone's points. You can find the rules here: https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%AF%CE%B1_(%CF%80%CE%B1%CE%B9%CF%87%CE%BD%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B9)
